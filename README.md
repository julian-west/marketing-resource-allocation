# Retail Marketing Analytics - Individual Project

In this assignment, you are required to apply at least one of the methods or models we have covered in this module to a dataset of your own choice. 

Your task is to write a report on how you would solve a particular retail/marketing problem or demonstrate a retail/marketing opportunity using one of the models or methods. There is some freedom in this report: the problem or opportunity can be something that is of interest to you or your organisation. 

Your report should be a maximum of 2500 words (double spaced, font size 12). Table of contents, reference list and appendices do not count against the word limit. 

## Assessment Criteria
The aim is to demonstrate that you understand the method or model and that you can apply it to a real-life situation. Criteria for success include: 
- Showing clarity of the definition and delineation of marketing problem or opportunity: what is the marketing problem/opportunity addressed? Is it clear and relevant?  (20%)
- Application of relevant models: are analyses sufficient and appropriate, and presented in a clear and comprehensive way? Are the findings interpreted in a way that makes sense? (30%)                                                                                                
- The quality of the data and the model consolidation into summaries and conclusions: what implications are drawn from the analyses?  (30%)					   
- The quality of the overall structure in terms of figures/tables and the overall logical flow. Is there a consistency between problem definition, modelling, results and implications? (20%)
